  abstract     = "This paper presents NFDIcore 2.0, an ontology compliant with
                  the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) designed to represent the
                  diverse research communities of the National Research Data
                  Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany. NFDIcore ensures the
                  interoperability across various research disciplines, thereby
                  facilitating cross-domain research. Each domain's individual
                  requirements are addressed through specific ontology modules.
                  This paper discusses lessons learned during the ontology
                  development and mapping process, supported by practical
                  validation through use cases in diverse research domains. The
                  originality of NFDIcore lies in its adherence to BFO, the use
                  of SWRL rules for efficient knowledge discovery, and its
                  modular, extensible design tailored to meet the needs of
                  heterogeneous research domains.",

               workflows/pipelines, tools/applications, support/consulting and
               web applications. For each category useful KPI have been defined

               to collect the respective indicators. This illustration gives a
               comprehensive overview of of the KPI mutually agreed upon in the
               de.NBI network and for further use in the scientific community.

               for the sharing and sustainability of life science data. To
               provide up-to-date resources and services, ELIXIR needs to
               undergo a continuous process of refreshing the services provided
               by its national Nodes. Here we present the approach taken by
               ELIXIR-UK to address the advice by the ELIXIR Scientific
               Advisory Board that Nodes need to develop `` mechanisms to
               ensure that each Node continues to be representative of the
               Bioinformatics efforts within the country''. ELIXIR-UK put in
               place an open and transparent process to identify potential
               ELIXIR resources within the UK during late 2015 and early to
               mid-2016. Areas of strategic strength were identified and
               Expressions of Interest in these priority areas were requested
               from the UK community. Criteria were established, in discussion
               with the ELIXIR Hub, and prospective ELIXIR-UK resources were
               assessed by an independent committee set up by the Node for this
               purpose. Of 19 resources considered, 14 were judged to be
               immediately ready to be included in the UK ELIXIR Node's
               portfolio. A further five were placed on the Node's roadmap for
               future consideration for inclusion. ELIXIR-UK expects to repeat
               this process regularly to ensure its portfolio continues to
               reflect its community's strengths.",
